# WGENERIC: A WGSL Generic Compute Tasking Library

To make generic compute shader only mathematic logic available at the user level:

- Fully WGSL expressed functions for generic compute tasks.
- Simple arithmetic, traditional matrix multiplication, ray-based rasterization, and more.
- Example for offloading generic work to GPU only via WGSL functions, only consuming CPU time for invocations.
